# What is this repository about?

This repository implements automated tests for Android & iOS apps, specified using cucumber-jvm and intelligently run
them against

* Android
* iOS
* Windows Apps
* Web

Applitools is integrated with this framework, to provide Visual AI testing as part of functional automation.

Reports will be uploaded to reportportal.io, that you would need to setup separately, and provide the server details in
src/test/resources/reportportal.properties file or provide the path to the file using this environment
variable: `REPORT_PORTAL_FILE`

## Tech stack used

* cucumber-jvm (https://cucumber.io)
* AppiumTestDistribution (https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/AppiumTestDistribution) -manages Android and iOS
  devices, and Appium
* Appium (https://appium.io)
* WebDriver (https://selenium.dev)
* reportportal.io (https://reportportal.io)
* Applitools (https://applitools.com)

## How can you use unified-e2e?
It is very easy to use unified-e2e in your framework.
Follow these steps:
1. Setup the prerequisites mentioned below
1. Provide capabilities in capabilities.json - refer to src/test/resources/com/znsio/e2e/features/android/caps/capabilities.json
1. Provide defaults in config.properties file - refer to src/test/resources/com/znsio/e2e/features/android/configs/config.properties
1. Refer to build.gradle.sample file and update your project's build.gradle accordingly
1. Refer to the **Running the tests** section

## Prerequisites

* JDK
  * **Minimum JDK version: 11**
  * **Set JAVA_HOME environment variable**
  * You can install JDK from here: https://adoptopenjdk.net/
* Setup the Android environment for test execution:
  * **Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable**
  * **Refer to this post for instructions how to automatically setup your environment - https://applitools.com/blog/automatic-appium-setup/**
  * Additional References:
    * Setup Android Command-line tools and SDK - https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools
    * Install appium - https://appium.io
* Appium Desktop App is a great way to identify locators, and the recorder is quite helpful to quickly identify multiple
  locators for your tests - https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/tag/v1.20.2. You can also use Katalon
  Studio for locator identification (especially helpful for Windows platform)
* To verify appium installation is successful, run
  `appium-doctor` - it should not report any errors
* To install reportportal on local machine, refer to https://reportportal.io/installation. (Docker setup is the easiest way to proceed).

## Running the tests

### Run on Android

To run all the tests against the Android platform, run the following command:

    PLATFORM=android ./gradlew run

#### Run on Local devices:

The framework, by default, automatically figures out if there are multiple devices connected to the machine, and if so,
will run the tests in parallel

#### Run on pCloudy's Device Farm:

**To enable running the tests on pCloudy's Device Farm, the following additional environment variables need to be provided:**

* `RUN_IN_CI=true` - Default is `false`
* `CLOUD_USER` - Mobilab username
* `CLOUD_KEY` - Mobilab password

Sample command:

    PLATFORM=android RUN_IN_CI=true CLOUD_USER=myusername CLOUD_KEY=abcd1234abcd ./gradlew run

For other cloud configurations, refer here: https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/AppiumTestDistribution

### Run on iOS

    PLATFORM=windows ./gradlew run

### Run on Windows

    PLATFORM=windows ./gradlew run

### Run on Web

    PLATFORM=web ./gradlew run

### Running Real Meeting simulations

The framework now supports running multiuser scenarios.

You can run these tests as below:

#### To run tests on **android & web** platforms

    TAG=@multiuser-android-web

**_Current restriction - 1 android device & max 2 web browsers_**

#### To run tests on **web** platforms

    TAG=@multiuser-web-web 

**_Current restriction - max 2 web browsers_**

## Additional configurations

### Logging the test logs

* The log4j.properties file is placed under ./src/test/resources directory
* The test logs are generated in the directory/file mentioned in the properties file as below
    log4j.appender.R.File=./${LOG_DIR}/testLogs/JioMeet_E2E_testlog.log
* LOG_DIR path is defined in the ./configs/config.properties file

### Running the tests with Applitools Visual AI

**To enable Applitools Visual Testing in your test execution, the following additional environment variables need to be
provided:**

* `IS_VISUAL=true` - to enable Visual Testing using Applitools
* `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<API_KEY>` - Sets the API key as provided by Applitools

### Running a subset of tests:

To run a subset of tests, for a given platform, the following additional environment variables need to be provided:

* `TAG=@schedule` - This will run all tests tagged with the platform name provided, except tests tagged as "@wip"
* `TAG="@schedule and @signup"` - This will run all tests tagged with the name **schedule AND signup** for the platform
  name provided, except tests tagged as "@wip"
* `TAG="@schedule or @signup"` - This will run all tests tagged with the name **schedule OR signup** for the platform
  name provided, except tests tagged as "@wip"

Sample commands:

    PLATFORM=android TAG=@schedule ./gradlew run`

    PLATFORM=android TAG="@schedule and @signup" ./gradlew run`

    PLATFORM=android TAG="@schedule or @signup" ./gradlew run`

### Using a different apk for execution (Android):

To run tests using a specific apk (instead of the one specified in caps/capabilities.json, OR,
caps/mobilab_capabilties.json, the following additional environment variable need to be provided:

* `APP_PATH='<path to apk>'`

Sample command:

    APP_PATH=~/Downloads/MyLatestApp.apk PLATFORM=android ./gradlew run

## Troubleshooting / FAQs

### Setting Environment Variables:

You can set environment variables

From Mac OSX or Linux:

    export PLATFORM=android

From Windows:

    set PLATFORM=android
